# EZHP-DIY_COREXY
<hr>
# Overview

This project documents my fully custom-built CoreXY 3D printer, designed from the ground up to be fast, precise, and reliable. Inspired by my fascination with additive manufacturing, I engineered this printer to push beyond the limitations of entry-level machines while remaining accessible to the maker community. The entire design — from CAD files to firmware configurations — is released as open source (non-commercial) so others can build, modify, and improve it.

# Features
	•	CoreXY Motion System – High-speed, belt-driven XY gantry for reduced inertia and better print quality at higher speeds.
	•	Rigid Aluminum Frame – CNC-cut and extrusion-based structure for stability and reduced vibration.
	•	Direct-Drive Extruder – Improves filament control, especially for flexible and specialty materials.
	•	Large Build Volume – [Insert your build volume here] for printing bigger parts without splitting models.
	•	Open Firmware Support – Compatible with Marlin, Klipper, or other open firmware.
	•	Modular Design – Easy to upgrade components like hotends, extruders, and motion parts.

# Why I Built It

I’ve been fascinated by 3D printing ever since I first saw a machine in action on YouTube. That moment sparked my passion for designing and building my own hardware. Over the years, I’ve created multiple mechanical projects, including a DIY CNC mill, and this CoreXY printer is my most ambitious build yet. It allowed me to apply my skills in CAD modeling, electronics integration, motion control, and mechanical engineering.

# Goals for the Project
	•	Provide the community with an open-source CoreXY design that can be adapted and improved.
	•	Encourage hands-on learning for anyone interested in mechanical design, motion control, or additive manufacturing.
	•	Maintain a non-commercial license so the design remains in the hands of makers, not corporations.

# Getting Started
	1.	Clone or download the repository.
	2.	Review the Bill of Materials (BOM) for all parts required.
	3.	Open the CAD files in [your CAD software, e.g., Fusion 360, FreeCAD, SolidWorks].
	4.	Review the assembly instructions and wiring diagrams.
	5.	Flash your preferred firmware and calibrate.
